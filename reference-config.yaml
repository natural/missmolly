# the first (and probably most useful) directive is `location`, which
# tells the router to match on this path and handle it as described.
#
- location: /launch/all/the/things

  # the content key is used as the handler for this location.  it
  # can be the name of a registered handler:
  content: RocketLauncherHandler

  # or can be a chunk of javascript code
  content: >-
    response.write("rockets launched!")

  # or it can be a path to a javascript file:
  content: file:scripts/rocketlauncher.js


# the `location` directive has oodles of options, here's a sample:
#
- location: /home/{user}

  # the `rewrite` directive ///
  rewrite: DenySomeRequestsRandomlyOnTuesdays

  # or via javascript:
  rewrite: >-
    var q = request.url.get("q")
    if (q === "rewrite") {
      response.Redirect("/greetings?who=earthling")
    }

  # `match` limits request processing to requests that meet the
  # declared criteria.
